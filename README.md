# Quiz-App

Hi there, thanks for visiting this amazing Node.js based backend API App.

I have made a Quiz App containing 5 endpoints for various tasks. I have also implemented the unit tests for each controller i am using and production level code with MVC Architecture has been used. 
I have also included a Postman collection for description to use these endpoints. 
I have deployed this on https://probable-nutritious-countess.glitch.me/. 

Tech. Stack - MERN 
Packages - Express, MongoDB, dotenv, Firebase, Jest, React

Note - Before testing on postman, make sure to:
1) Go to https://fibr-quiz-app.netlify.app/ and click on Login With Google. You will recieve an access-token in browser console window which will be needed in authorization purpose while testing on Postman.
2) Go to Headers in Postman :
   a) Put Key -> Content-Type, value -> Application/json
   b) Put Key -> Authorization, value -> access token
3) Now, you are all set to test this cool application!

Hope you like it!
